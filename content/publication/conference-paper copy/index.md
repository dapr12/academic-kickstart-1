abstract: Sepsis is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in hospitals. In this paper we propose a machine learning approach for anomaly detection to aid the early detection of sepsis. Using the medical data of over 40,000 patients, we use both unsupervised and supervised methods to extract relevant features from the data, and then use standard classification approaches to predict sepsis six hours before clinical diagnosis occurs. To extract features, we use the reconstruction error of an autoencoding neural network trained on health patients, and use random forest classifiers to learn the most important features for the classification of patients. We then combined the features from both of these approaches with a variety of standard classification models. We find the best classification utility function is achieved with a logistic regression classifier.
